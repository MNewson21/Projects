This is my project I created through my experience with wireless connections. The email will be verified through Supabase authentication and then once authenticated, you can access the notes from anywhere since they are stored in an online database. I have added policies to the database to stop people maxing out the rate limit and so that each user can only insert, edit and delete their own notes.<br><br> To start this project, just run the main.java folder and then login/signup with an email and apassword, and once the email has been verified, you can add and copy down notes freely. The project uses Http requests to get and put data from the tables and is done through JSON objects. <br>
