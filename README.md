Hello I am Miles Newson <br> <br>
This is my personal git for projects that I make alongside studying Computer Science <br> 
- I am currently in the second year of my degree as of this readme update <br>
- This is also used to improve my proficiency in languages that I know <br> 
- I also do leetcode in my spare time ~ https://leetcode.com/u/milesn/ <br> <br>

The main languages I am using / learning about at the moment are
- Java
- C
- Lean

If you see this, thank you for taking the time to view my repository <br>
peace <br>
