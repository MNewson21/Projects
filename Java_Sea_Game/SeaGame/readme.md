# Sea Game
This is a java project of mine that I created because I wanted to get better at applying software-engineering principles such as SOLID, CUPID, DRY + KISS.

<br>
This game is created using JavaFX combined with FXML using a simple Maven Archetype

The aim of this game is to keep the Turtle alive and gain as many points as possible

This game is still in development, and I am trying to consistently work on it

Since it is not finished, you can find my [Changelog](Docs/changelog.md)

This is what the current game looks like :
